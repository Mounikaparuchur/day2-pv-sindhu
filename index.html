Soon after, she joined <mark>Pullela Gopichand's Gopichand Badminton Academy.</mark> While profiling her career, a correspondent with The Hindu wrote:</p>
 <p>"The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, traveling a distance of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment."</p>
  <p>Gopichand seconded this correspondent's opinion when he said that "<mark>the most striking feature in Sindhu's game is her attitude and the never-say-die spirit.</mark>" After joining Gopichand's badminton academy, Sindhu won several titles. In the under-10 years category, she won the fifth Servo All India ranking championship in the doubles category and the singles title at the Ambuja Cement All India ranking.
